# Unity Utilities

Over the years, I've worked on a lot of [projects](http://dragonlab.de/portfolio) and [game jam prototypes](http://blog.dragonlab.de/tag/unity) with Unity3D and there are some pieces of code that I've needed time and time again. I'm sharing them here in the hopes that they are useful for you too! It's just a few scripts for now, but expect updates with more once I clean them up.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please add an [Issue](https://github.com/TobiasWehrum/unity-utilities/issues) here or send me a mail at Tobias.Wehrum@dragonlab.de.

## Overview

## Usage

To use them, just drop them into the Assets folder of your projects. (Or better yet, make an "Assets/Extensions/UnityUtitilites" folder and drop them there. Hurray for proper organisation.)

## Changelog
* 2015-05-08: Added RangeFloat, RangeInt, Countdown, CountdownProperty, NoiseOutputValue, SingletonMonoBehaviour and PersistentSingletonMonoBehaviour. (Including the editor classes RangePropertyDrawerBase, RangeFloatPropertyDrawer, RangeIntPropertyDrawer and CountdownPropertyDrawer.)
